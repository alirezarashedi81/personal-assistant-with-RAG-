PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
I help industries build and deploy machine learning, deep learning, large language models, and computer vision solutions enabling intelligent data analysis, automated client interaction, and real-time CCTV processing. I specialize in production-ready models for object detection, image segmentation, text extraction, gesture-driven interfaces, and generative AI workflows. I deliver end-to-end solutions covering data collection, preprocessing, annotation, training, hyperparameter optimization, containerization, and cloud deployment to ensure scalable and maintainable systems.
